var story1 = "The Pão Nosso vegan bread was created back in 2015 in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil by Adriana Mello, co-founder of the brand. The daily bread was originally crafted as a hobby to be shared between family and friends. Her bread received so much love from her friends that Adriana realized that her bread could become so much more. She decided to take a step forward and turn her home-made bread into her business."

var story2 = "Now, Pão Nosso is a bread produced in Southern California, made from only organic ingredients without any preservatives. Pão Nosso is a mix of unique ingredients that combine to give the customer a true experience of health and satisfaction. The founders of Pão Nosso bread believe that eating bread can be more than a satisfied stomach - it can be a whole experience of sharing moments, tastes and memories with family and friends."
